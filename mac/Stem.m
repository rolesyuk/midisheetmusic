/** @class Stem
 * The Stem class is used by ChordSymbol to draw the stem portion of
 * the chord.  The stem has the following fields:
 *
 * duration  - The duration of the stem.
 * direction - Either StemUp or StemDown
 * side      - Either left or right
 * top       - The topmost note in the chord
 * bottom    - The bottommost note in the chord
 * end       - The note position where the stem ends.  This is usually
 *             six notes past the last note in the chord.  For 8th/16th
 *             notes, the stem must extend even more.
 *
 * The class can change the direction of a stem after it
 * has been created.  The side and end fields may also change due to
 * the direction change.  But other fields will not change.
